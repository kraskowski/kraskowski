# Hey there, I'm Florian! Nice to meet you!

### Digital enthusiast with a big passion for transformation and innovation. 

I'm a ***Project Engineer / Project Manager*** at DB with the focus on telecommunications and infrastructre developing my skills in management and telecommunication systems. Before that, I worked in the automotive and aviation industry with a focus for ***digitalization and continuous improvement***. 

During this time, I learned about topics like ***IIoT*** and ***Digital Twin***, which I have been excited about ever since. Based on this, I used my expertise to create a ***Blockchain Architecture for the Internet-of-Things*** as part of my master's thesis. 
Besides, I am currently working on ***IIoT*** with regard to ***cyber security*** and ***digital twin***.
